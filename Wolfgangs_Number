Todo: Find a special date where Unix Time is the same as the date (ISO-Code style, only numbers up to the hour - 10 digits)

Result: 2034061611 (I call it "Wolfgang's number" ;-)  The 16th of June 2034 at 11 o'clock. Let's celebrate it!

Cool! The number seems to be unknown up to now. Google shows nothing for it.

My script to find it:

#!/bin/bash
UNIXTIME=2034000000

while [ $UNIXTIME -lt 2100000000 ]; do
	DATE=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H" -d @$UNIXTIME)
	echo "Unixtime: $UNIXTIME  Date: $DATE"
	if [ $UNIXTIME = $DATE ]; then
		echo "Found special date to unix time:"
		echo "Unixtime: $UNIXTIME"
		echo "Date: $DATE = $(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H" -d @$UNIXTIME)"
		break
	fi
	UNIXTIME=$(($UNIXTIME+1))
done
